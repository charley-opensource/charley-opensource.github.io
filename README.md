## 1. Keycloak

![Keycloak](./img/keycloak.png)

[Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) is an open-source identity and access management server that enables modern applications to secure their services easily. It is developed by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and is based on open standards such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML. The project has accumulated a total of **25.4k ‚≠ê** on GitHub (as of 20/02/2025).

### 1.1 üü† [BUG](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/34724): CI Issue Due to Duplicate Group Names 

![Issues](./img/pr_desc_keycloak_1.png)

This [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/34724/files) improves end-to-end (E2E) tests and the groups page in the Keycloak admin interface. Here are the key steps:

1. **Added an error message for duplicate groups:**  
   - A `duplicatedGroupErrorMessage` constant was introduced to store specific error messages for duplicate group creation.  

2. **Updated E2E tests:**  
   - Tests were modified to check the new error messages when attempting to create duplicate groups.  
   - A previously skipped test was re-enabled to verify failed creation attempts for duplicate group names.  

3. **Modified `assertNotificationCouldNotCreateGroupWithDuplicatedName` method:**  
   - The method was updated to take a second argument, `errorMessage`, to validate error messages for duplicate group names.

### 1.2 üü† [BUG](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/34721): Key Status Filtering Issue in the `KeysListTab`  

![Issues](./img/pr_desc_keycloak_2.png)

This [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/34721/files) fixes an issue with key filtering in the `KeysListTab` of Keycloak‚Äôs admin interface. Key improvements:

1. **Added `useMemo` for optimized filtering:**  
   - `useMemo` was introduced alongside `useState` to improve filtering performance.  

2. **Introduced a `filter` state for filtering options:**  
   - A new `filter` state was added, initialized with the first option in `FILTER_OPTIONS`.  

3. **Used `useMemo` for key filtering:**  
   - `useMemo` now filters `keyData` based on the selected `filter` state.  

4. **Updated `keyData` and `filteredKeyData` initialization:**  
   - These states are now initialized as empty arrays.  

5. **Simplified the `SelectFilter` component:**  
   - It now directly updates the `filter` state instead of modifying `filteredKeyData`.

The project has accumulated **600 ‚≠ê** on GitHub (as of 20/02/2025) and was created by [Thomas Mauran](https://github.com/thomas-mauran), a final-year computer science student at Polytech Montpellier.

### 2.1 üü† [BUG](https://github.com/thomas-mauran/chess-tui/issues/44): Prevent Selecting a Piece with No Possible Moves

![Issues](./img/issues_chess_1.png)

This [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/thomas-mauran/chess-tui/pull/45) fixes the piece selection logic in Chess TUI. Key changes:

1. **Added a verification before selecting a piece:**  
   - Code was added to check whether the selected piece can move before allowing its selection.  

2. **Updated cell selection method:**  
   - The `is_cell_selected` method was updated to validate if the selected piece has valid moves. If not, the selection is canceled.

![PR_description](./img/pr_desc_chess_2.png)

This [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/thomas-mauran/chess-tui/pull/43/files) improves the in-game help popup by enhancing the display of game controls. Key updates:

1. **Modified the display of game controls:**  
   - `vec![]` formatted text was replaced with simple string literals.  

2. **Added new game instructions:**  
   - Added "SPACE_BAR: Select a piece".  
   - Added "ESCAPE: Deselect a piece".  

3. **Minor formatting corrections:**  
   - Titles such as "Game controls:" and "Color codes:" now use simpler string formats.  

 

In summary, this PR improves readability and enhances the game control instructions in the help popup.
